<h3>NTU STUDENT HOUSING:  A GAME OF SNAKES AND LADDERS</h3>
<br/><br/></div><p>
<span class="firstcharacter">I</span>magine - you’ve just finished your first year of studies at NTU. You are no longer a “freshie”, and, you’ve survived the transition from high school to university. Now, it’s time to get ready for your second year, and that means getting back into hall.</p><br/><p>

There are eighteen halls of residence at NTU, each having it’s own unique traditions. Some halls are known to win every dance competition, while others take pride in their athletic achievements. First year students are guaranteed a place in hall. However, from here on in is where the game begins.</p><br/><p>

Students choose between three uphill paths to gain their place in hall.</p><br/><p>

The first route to move up the board is the Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) route. This route will take you straight to the Porsche of all ladders, and provide an almost guaranteed ride to your place in hall. The IVP is a sports competition between all polytechnics and universities in Singapore. Athletes skilled enough to represent NTU in these contests are highly regarded when it comes to hall life. Simply put – if you’re a good sportsman, you won’t be seeing many snakes.</p><br/><p>

If your running does not resemble Usain Bolt, or football skills that don’t resemble Cristiano Ronaldo, there is another way up the board. NTU has a detailed points system, whereby students accrue points to increase their chance of landing a dorm. You live far away – 1 ladder; you’re always going to hall activities – another ladder, you’re an exchange student – a very, very small ladder. You don’t tick any of these boxes? OH NO – IT’S A KILLER PYTHON – and down the board you go.</p><br/><p>

Don’t worry – there is a final ladder available, though this is the wobbliest of them all. Each hall has a Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC). The JCRC are like the dice in the game – they decide whether you progress up in the game, or not. Students can apply to be placed on a recommendation list, and the JCRC will determine whether they get a dorm. This is where students learn a valuable life lesson – it’s not always what you know, but whom you know. </p><br/><p>

There is great suspicion in the transparency of the “recce” system, with many students claiming the JCRC to be corrupt, and only recommending their friends. The idea is that students are recommended based on their contribution to hall life, through activities and the like. However, the reality is the JCRC will mostly put their friends ahead of others, regardless of who has participated in hall life more. This means that students who work hard in improving their hall may miss out, leaving them with no ladders and a lot of snakes, the result being expensive off-campus housing. </p><br/><p>

Perhaps the student housing system is reflective of life to come – sometimes, there are far more snakes than ladders.

<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> wish my parents had pushed me to be an athlete when I was younger. It would save me the trouble of playing snakes and ladders now in university.</p><br/><p>

Chances are that if you play a sport and are fairly good at it, you’re hot property in NTU. Some envy you for your athleticism, other want to be you for all the fame and attention. But mostly all they want is to have a guaranteed place in hall for their four years in NTU.</p><br/><p>

The Inter-Varsity-Polytechnic competition pits all of Singapore’s main tertiary education system, mainly the six universities and five polytechnics, in a sports competition.</p><br/><p>
Athletes will be competing against some of Singapore’s best sporting talents, some of which are actual trained national athletes that have represented the republic in the world stage.</p><br/><p>

As such, their training regimen is strict, and they barely have time to themselves from juggling their studies and commitment to trainings. Lucky for them NTU guarantees athletes a place in hall as long as they are considered good enough to be in the team and represent NTU by their coaches.</p><br/><p>

The good news for them is that they don’t have to worry themselves over the politics of getting famous in hall, or compete for a spot on the Recommendation List. The only commitment they have is to make a few cameo appearances in the matches of their hall’s Inter-Hall Games.</p><br/><p>

Basically they get the climb the express ladder to the end of the board while others are still trying to make it to the first square.</p><br/><p>

The bad news is that with fresh new faces coming in every year, your spot in the team becomes less and less solid over the course of the next three years of university. Competition to be in the team is extremely tough and only the members of the first team in each sport are guaranteed a place in hall.</p><br/><p>

If you live somewhere in the east, I suggest taking up a sport and actually be good at it as soon as you can. Otherwise get ready to top up your ez-link on a weekly basis.</p>

<span class="firstcharacter">E</span>very December the 18 halls in NTU compete against one another across two sporting categories – the Inter-Hall Games and the Inter-Hall Recreational Games.
Participation is of course obligatory, but if you’re planning to stay in hall the next year, then it’s mandatory.</p><br/><p>

Victory in the hall games earn you bragging rights for the next year, whilst defeat most likely gets you a snake and down two places you go in your search for a spot in hall.
</p><br/><p>
Each hall competes in different sports, such as football, basketball, swimming as well as recreational games like Othello, Bridge and Scrabble. If the JCRC members ever ask you if you’ve done anything to deserve a place in hall, a go to answer would be, “I played in ____ in the hall games this year.”
</p><br/><p>
Just playing the game doesn’t guarantee you a spot though. Otherwise places in hall would be impossible to get.
</p><br/><p>
Traditionally halls Two, Three and Sixteen are the traditional power houses in the sports with Hall Three the reigning champions for the past three years. Other halls, such as Hall Eight and Four are better known for their dancers that compete in the closing ceremony of the hall games called the Hall Olympiad Closing Ceremony.
</p><br/><p>
Here’s the rule of thumb – if you’re a dancer in a hall that is more known for its dominant sports culture, you better think of jumping ship to another hall or risk getting eaten by another snake.
</p><br/><p>
The hall games are also an opportunity for you to increase your ‘hall presence’. What better way to show your face than by being the cheerleader at your hall’s matches.
</p><br/><p>
Once the season is over, depending on how well your hall faired, either climb up the ladder and inch one step closer to glory, or you might as well start packing your bags now because down the snake you go.</p>

<span class="firstcharacter">C</span>ongratulations, you’ve made it this far. You’ve climbed ladders, and you’ve been eaten alive by snakes, but all that doesn’t matter now because you’ve finally made it to the final stage of your search for the Holy Grail – the Recommendation List interview.</p><br/><p>

You’ll be interviewed by the top five members of the JCRC along with the main Hall Fellow – the NTU faculty that lives in the hall.</p><br/><p>

They’ll ask you very simple questions, albeit with the seriousness of a judge weighing whether you are guilty or innocent. They’ll ask, “So what have you done for hall?” or “What can you offer us in exchange for a place in hall?” and the most popular question the Hall Fellow will ask you, “You’re on the recommendation list? Why don’t I ever see your face around hall?”</p><br/><p>

If the hall fellow asks you that question, you are better off leaving the interview, pack your bags, and call your parents to pick you up because public transport won’t get you home any faster than going down the snake’s belly.</p><br/><p>

If you’re confident of getting your place in hall, then congratulations are in order. The interview will feel like catching up with old friends over a cup of coffee and at the end of it you’ll be asked to sign a contract as a commitment to the activities you’ll be involved with in hall for the next year.</p><br/><p>

You’ve made it to the end. You’ve gotten your place in hall for the next year.
You deserve to celebrate and rest, because you’ll need it since you’re starting all over again soon.</p><br/><p>

Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favour.</p>
